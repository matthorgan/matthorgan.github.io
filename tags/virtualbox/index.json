        "body": "I\u0026rsquo;ve been using vagrant to build up labs for my work recently and it\u0026rsquo;s an awesome product. One small downside is the sheer amount of space that the new VMs were taking up on my laptop SSD (I\u0026rsquo;d been testing linked clones and hadn\u0026rsquo;t cleaned up after myself). As my whole lab build was in code, I felt rather pleased with myself that I could just bin the whole environment including any VMs and then just spin it up again afterwards. So, off I went to the VirtualBox VM directory (\u0026quot;$env:userprofile\\VirtualBox VMs\u0026quot;). When I looked at the total size of the directory, it was over 100GB in space and because being heavy handed works so well in I.T (Hmm\u0026hellip;), I deleted all of the VMs in the folder.\nRight, time to \u0026lsquo;vagarnt up\u0026rsquo; my lab and sit back and watch the infrastructure as code goodness:\nAH! Perhaps my heavy handed approach probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best idea. It seems like there might be some sort of lock on the files Vagrant is trying to use. Wait, there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any files needed because they\u0026rsquo;ve all been deleted, right? Looking in VirtualBox shows that it still thinks the VMs exist but are inaccessible (I forgot to grab a screenshot, sorry!). To fix this, I deleted the inaccessible VMs from within VirtualBox and ran a \u0026lsquo;vagrant up\u0026rsquo; again and it imported a fresh box with no errors.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m using linked clones for my environment, Vagrant must have been looking for the initial clone that my lab was supposed to be using (The one that I\u0026rsquo;d heavy handedly deleted). As VirtualBox still thought it had the clone in existence, Vagrant was spitting out errors when trying to build the lab.\n"
