# Blog Repo

## Details

Under the hood, the blog is using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Web Framework. The `main` branch in this repo is where the blog content
is added and then the website is statically generated and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. The [build-site.yml](https://github.com/matthorgan/matthorgan.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-site.yml) file in the `main` branch defines a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build and push to `gh-pages` each time a commit has
been pushed to the `main` branch.
