# Blog Repo

## Details

Under the hood, the blog is using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Web Framework. The `source` branch in this repo is where the blog content
is added and then the website is statically generated and pushed to the `master` branch. The [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/matthorgan/matthorgan.github.io/blob/source/appveyor.yml) file in the `source` branch configures an AppVeyor project to automate the build and push to master each time a commit has
been pushed to the `source` branch.
