    <p>I&rsquo;ve been using vagrant to build up labs for my work recently and it&rsquo;s an awesome product. One small downside is the sheer amount of space that the new VMs were taking up on my laptop SSD (I&rsquo;d been testing linked clones and hadn&rsquo;t cleaned up after myself). As my whole lab build was in code, I felt rather pleased with myself that I could just bin the whole environment including any VMs and then just spin it up again afterwards. So, off I went to the VirtualBox VM directory (&quot;$env:userprofile\VirtualBox VMs&quot;). When I looked at the total size of the directory, it was over 100GB in space and because being heavy handed works so well in I.T (Hmm&hellip;), I deleted all of the VMs in the folder.</p>
<p>Right, time to &lsquo;vagarnt up&rsquo; my lab and sit back and watch the infrastructure as code goodness:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthorgan.xyz/img/vagrant-fail.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>AH! Perhaps my heavy handed approach probably wasn&rsquo;t the best idea. It seems like there might be some sort of lock on the files Vagrant is trying to use. Wait, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any files needed because they&rsquo;ve all been deleted, right? Looking in VirtualBox shows that it still thinks the VMs exist but are inaccessible (I forgot to grab a screenshot, sorry!). To fix this, I deleted the inaccessible VMs from within VirtualBox and ran a &lsquo;vagrant up&rsquo; again and it imported a fresh box with no errors.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m using linked clones for my environment, Vagrant must have been looking for the initial clone that my lab was supposed to be using (The one that I&rsquo;d heavy handedly deleted). As VirtualBox still thought it had the clone in existence, Vagrant was spitting out errors when trying to build the lab.</p>
